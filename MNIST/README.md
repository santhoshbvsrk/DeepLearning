This project contains MNIST datasets from KERAS to perform Image Classification for Fashion & Digit Recognizer datasets using various features of Simple Neural Networks viz., Regularizer, Dropouts & Callbacks.

Here, we've used two different datasets:

 1. Identifying the Digit in the picture (picture data is provided by 
    pixel values from different columns in the dataset). ---> Fashion_MNIST.![enter image description here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/3682850e-dc4d-4c07-a2c8-4e58a721b65b/f50369fd-32ea-477d-b74c-1b3f6e014122/images/screenshot.gif)
  2. Identifying the Product in image (picture data is provided by pixel values 		  from different columns in the dataset). ---> DigitRecognizer
