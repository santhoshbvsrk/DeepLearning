This project contains MNIST datasets from KERAS to perform Image Classification for Fashion & Digit Recognizer datasets using various features of Simple Neural Networks viz., Regularizer, Dropouts & Callbacks.

Here, we've used two different datasets:

 1. Identifying the Digit in the picture (picture data is provided by pixel values from different columns in the dataset). ---> Fashion_MNIST.  
 2. Identifying the Product in image (picture data is provided by pixel values from different columns in the dataset). ---> DigitRecognizer
