## Content

 - Military conflict is an intense state of violence.
 
 -  In such situations, it is crucial for a nation to stay alert, cope with it, and mitigate its implications. 
   
 - A country has set up the DEFCON (Defense Readiness Condition) warning system.
   
 - This alert system is used to gauge the level of alertness of the defense forces.     
   
 - It consists of five levels of readiness for the    military forces to be prepared for the consequences of the conflict.
   
 - The DEFCON system allows the nationâ€™s forces to be a step ahead of its rivals.
   
 - You are given a synthesized data that can be used to build a model that can accurately predict the DEFCON level raised as a result of
   the conflict. 
   
 - The data is present in a single csv file:    defcon_level.csv - Dataset consisting of approximately 10,000 data    samples.

## Objective

 - This dataset is intended for multi-class classification tasks. 
 - Use this data set to train a model able to classify the different DEFCON levels based on certain conditions.
